### Azure Functions

This is the Azure Function which was used during the demo to show you to the integration of Bot Framework Composer with the HTTP call. 

### AI Hack Day Bot

You can fork / clone this repo to your local machine then you will easily be able to open the same bot in the Composer. I have included the same bot as I have built [here in this video](https://youtu.be/RQ38cbnRQIc). You can refer it while you are developing your own cool bot.
