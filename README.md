# Welcome to Azure Cognitive Services learning material

In this Gitbook well have a look at how to use various Azure Cognitive Services, what they can do for us and some of the examples of where you can use them.

# What is Azure Cognitive Services?

Azure Cognitive Services is a collection of AI services, allowing you to tackle business problems without requiring specialized AI knowledge

With Azure Cognitive Services you can tackle hard machine learning problems like facial recognition, text analysis, speech-to-text, personalization and AI tasks.

The services ranges anywhere from zero configuration like text analysis, data management like facial recognition, all the way to assisted machine learning like custom vision.

In zero configuration services you won't need to add any of your data to use Azure Cognitive Services.

For example, you can do sentiment analysis, speech-to-text, translation, and image recognition out of the box.

Then there are services, where you need to upload data and are generally not difficult to use. A good example of that is facial recognition, where we need to upload faces for each person to be recognized. Services like language understanding, and QnA Maker also require you to add your own data.

Then there are services like custom vision and personaliser, where data entry is a bit more envolved and may require a bit of data science knowledge to get best results.

# Get started

All of the content in this learning material will require Azure Portal and most if not all of the services will be free. Get started with [12 months free Azure Portal](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/free).

With 12 months trial, you'll have access to S0/S1 tier of AI services for free and after those 12 months, you'll continue being able to use most of the AI services with F0 (free) tier. The difference between tiers depends on the services but generally means that you can more calls for a time period and no monthly budget. You can use free tier for all of the examples.
